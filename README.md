# Most Common Programming Case Types

### camelCase

- camelCase must (1) start with a lowercase letter and (2) the first letter of every new subsequent word has its first letter capitalized and is compounded with the previous word.
- Example: `camelCaseVar`

### snake_case

- snake*case is as simple as replacing all spaces with a "*" and lowercasing all the words. It's possible to snake_case and mix camelCase and PascalCase but IMO, but this ultimately defeats the purpose.
- Example: `snake_case_var`

### kebab-case

- kebab-case is as simple as replacing all spaces with a "-" and lowercasing all the words. It's possible to kebab-case and mix camelCase and PascalCase but that ultimately defeats the purpose.
- Example: `kebab-case-var`

### PascalCase

- PascalCase has every word starting with an uppercase letter (unlike camelCase in that the first word starts with a lowercase letter).
- Example: `PascalCaseVar`
- Note: It's common to see this confused for camel case, but it's a separate case altogether.

### UPPER_CASE_SNAKE_CASE

- UPPER*CASE_SNAKE_CASE is replacing all the spaces with a "*" and converting all the letters to capitals.
- Example: `UPPER_CASE_SNAKE_CASE_VAR`
